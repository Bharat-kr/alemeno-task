<h1>Alenemo Task</h1>

To Run the application first we need to .env files in both frontend and backend.

I have attached sample env files in both.

#####Keep note that the file name i kept is .env.example remove .example from it to use that file if you are already having a mongoDB locally installed.

<h6>FOR the DATABASE_URL in backend env you can run a mongoDB container and docker and add its link also.</h6>

<p>Then Start the Backend Server using </p>

### `cd backend`

### `npm start`

<p>open another Terminal</p>

### `cd frontend`

### `npm start`

-> Now you are ready to use the application
